**This project aims to develop a real-time chat application using React for the frontend and Firebase for the backend.**

The Chatty app will allow users to:

* **Create accounts:** Users can register for a new account or log in with existing credentials.
* **Create chat rooms:** Users can create public or private chat rooms.
* **Join chat rooms:** Users can join existing public chat rooms or be invited to private ones.
* **Send and receive messages:** Users can send text messages in real time.
* **View chat history:** Users can view previous messages in a chat room.

Key features and functionalities will include:

* **Real-time messaging:** Using Firebase's Realtime Database or Cloud Firestore for instant message delivery.
* **User authentication:** Implementing user authentication using Firebase Authentication.
* **Chat room management:** Allowing users to create, join, and leave chat rooms.
* **Message history:** Storing and retrieving message history for each chat room.
* **User profiles:** Providing basic user profile information (e.g., username, display name).

By building Chatty, I will demonstrate my understanding of React, JavaScript, and Firebase. I will also gain experience in developing real-time applications, handling user authentication, and managing data in a cloud-based environment.
